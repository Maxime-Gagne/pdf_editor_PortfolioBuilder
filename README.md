# PortfolioBuilder
The Privacy-First PDF Assembler & Editor

Thank you for choosing PortfolioBuilder! 
We built this tool because we believe you shouldn't have to pay a monthly subscription just to merge a few files, and you shouldn't have to upload your private documents to unknown servers.

PortfolioBuilder runs 100% locally on your computer. Your files never leave your machine.

========================================================================
🚀 QUICK START GUIDE
========================================================================

1. Unzip the folder.
   (Do not run the .exe directly from inside the ZIP, extract the folder first).

2. Double-click on "PortfolioBuilder.exe".

3. A black console window might appear briefly, then your default web browser will open automatically with the application ready to use.

4. Start building:
   - Click "Open Base PDF" to load your main document.
   - Click "Add PDF File" (sidebar) to merge other documents (CV, Cover Letter, Projects...).
   - Drag and drop pages in the sidebar to reorder them.
   - Use "Whiteout" to hide old text and "Text" to add new information.
   - Click "SAVE & EXPORT" when you are done.
  
5. ✒️ CUSTOMIZING THE SIGNATURE
The app comes with a default signature tool. To use your own signature:
1. Open the "static" folder located next to the application.
2. Replace the file named "signature.png" with your own image file.
   (Note: Use a PNG with a transparent background for best results).
3. Ensure your file is named exactly "signature.png".
4. Restart the app.

========================================================================
⚠️ WINDOWS SECURITY WARNING ("Unknown Publisher")
========================================================================

When you launch the app for the first time, Windows Defender might show a blue window saying: 
"Windows protected your PC. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting."

This is normal for independent software that hasn't paid for an expensive corporate certificate.

To run the app:
1. Click on "More info" (under the text).
2. Click the "Run anyway" button.

This only happens once.
